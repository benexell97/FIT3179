        <h3>World Suicides Averages Per 100,000</h3>
        <p>
          This chloropleth map shows the differences in overall suicide rates for different countries. Higher rates are indicated
          by a darker colour, with lighter colours indicating a lower suicide rate. Countries that do not appear in the visualisation simply have no data available
          in the dataset, an example of this is China which does not officially release their suicide data. The highest visible suicide rate is in Lithuania, there are many
          factors to consider in this particularly high suicide rate. In fact many countries that were part of the CCCP tend to have a suicide rate[1] likely due
          to the effects of the oppressive regime the CCCP imposed on its countries with Lithuania being just the highest example.

        <h3>Continent Suicides Stream</h3>
        <p> This stream graph shows the suicide rates (per 100,000) of different continents each year from 1985-2016, to highlight a particular continents
          click on the legend.
        </br></br>
        We can see a particularly large rate occured in 1988, this could be due to the ongoing cold war between the USSR and Western World.
        When looking at the rates of both Asia and Africa, they are quite high, this could potentially be due to a number of wars that occured as
        a result of the Cold War in these regions including the Russian-Afghanistan War, the Angola Civil war, the Middle East conflict and the Salvadoran and
        Nicaraguan Civil wars[2].
        </br></br>
        In general, the standard of living worldwide especially in the western world has increased[3], likely leading to the decrease in overall suicides that can be seen from 1988 onwards, This
        also implies that the presence of significant world conflicts has a significant effect on the suicide rates.
